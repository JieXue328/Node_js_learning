## 3.1 What is NPM
NPM stands for Node Package Manager

It is responsible for managing all the Node.js packages and modules present in an Application

* Simpler than SOAP
* Default package manager of Node.js
* Completely written in JavaScript

1. Provides online repositories for packages/modules for Node.js which you can easily search online on their official site
2. It also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) which helps the developers in locally interacting with their system

## 3.2 Need for NPM
1. Helps in incorporating the pre-built package packages into our projects
2. Assists in downloading various standalone tools which can be used right away
3. Using npx, you can even run packages without having to download it
4. Developers often use NPM to share their code with other NPM users
5. Helps in restricting the code to specific developers and forming virtual teams using orgs
6. Helps in managing and maintaining various versions of codes and their dependencies
7. NPM automatically updates the application with the update in the underlying codes
